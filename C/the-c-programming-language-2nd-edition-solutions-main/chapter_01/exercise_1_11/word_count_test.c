// NOTE: To test the program it is necessary to write multiple lines, words, and
// of course characters in input. Also it's very nice to use some escape sequence
// such as tabs for example. To identify problems or bugs it's necessary to test
// the isolated contexts like no characters in input or a very long word in input
// or even a huge sequence of white spaces.
